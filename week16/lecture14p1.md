notes:
Look at all the stuff we covered!

## Extra credit: Network Viz

notes:
keep in mind that we have an extra credit assignment, worth 1 homework grade, that is in this week's page

also recall that the maximum you can get on the homework is 100% of that category, so if you have a perfect HW score, you can't do better than that!

## Notes on Final, Part 3

Due dates:
 1. First draft of Part 3 -- due Dec 8th, will get feedback course participants
 1. Post your link in the Moodle forum to get feedback from classmates
 1. Provide feedback for 3 randomly assigned classmates -- due Dec 12th
 1. Final chance to resubmit your Part 3 -- due Dec 14th (placeholder submission link)

because we have to get grades in by a certain time, these due dates are hard ones -- no extensions.

your "first" part 3 submission CAN be a work in progress -- you can outline what you want to do, but the more you have done, the better we can give you feedback and the more there is for your other feedback-giving classmates to work with

your "first" part 3 submission CAN be a work in progress -- you can outline what you want to do, but the more you have done, the better we can give you feedback and the more there is for your other feedback-giving classmates to work with

be aware that the due dates have shifted a little bit -- the first draft of your final part 3 has moved up, but the final submission has moved back -- this is so that you'll have plenty of time to get feedback and give feedback to others.
