    title: The Mobility dataset (online)
    description: A dataset of USA "mobility" which (I <b>think</b> comes from a <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2018/adrm/CES-WP-18-40R.html">a large census study from 1989-2015</a>) and is collected in several places <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/15/hw/01/mobility.csv">including right here</a>.  Here "mobility" is refering to how easy it is for a person to move up in economic status (<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/15/hw/01/hw-01.pdf">more info can be found here</a>) based on factors like parental income, location, race, etc.
