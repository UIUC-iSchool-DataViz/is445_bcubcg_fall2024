# day 2/3 -- "grab bag" of other things
# multi-page apps? ==> maybe day 2? ==> does this work with HF apps??
# Week 12 --  https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases <- touch on but say we'll be just doing csv files
# Week 12 -- embedding streamlit spaces on other webpages? wait until Jekyll? https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-streamlit#embed-streamlit-spaces-on-other-webpages
