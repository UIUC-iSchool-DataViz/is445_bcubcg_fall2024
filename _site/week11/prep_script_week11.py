# day 2/3 -- "grab bag" of other things
# touch on widgets! -- do quick example of plot + widget, say we'll focus on Altair
# multi-page apps? ==> maybe day 2? ==> does this work with HF apps??
# matplotlib plots
# other plotting tools in ST (like the defaults) + widgets
#* https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/databases <- touch on but say we'll be just doing csv files
# embedding streamlit spaces on other webpages? wait until Jekyll? https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-sdks-streamlit#embed-streamlit-spaces-on-other-webpages
# how to search/duplicate other spaces on HF (make sure you cite this!)

# start with "this is how we publish with streamlit" -- README file, requirements, etc
# ---> make sure to mention the "yaml-ness" of the README file
# ---> say that the easiest way to start is with an already hosted app on HF -- luckily we alread have a lab on this!
# ---> make this like the "jekyll updates" folders that have all these prep and in class files in them
# Then: more streamlit extras with all of those ones listed above
